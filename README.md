## Overview

Electron provides easy access to desktop program development along with incredibly robust user interface.
It should be used as what is is; a robust UI framework that shouldn't directly handle any real calculations.
Instead, tasks should be delegated to processes running in languages that are more suited for performance.
Ideal scenarios for use:
* A desktop experience, offering confidence and professionalism in the user experience
* Heavy loads that must or should be run on the client side
* Tools that need to project professionalism

## Extra Dependencies Used
* Electron Webpack (and Electron Builder, Webpack, Source Map Support)
* Inversify (and Reflect Metadata)
* Electron Store
* Bootstrap Grid
